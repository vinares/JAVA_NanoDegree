        // Note the above link talks about connecting to H2 database, for this exercise, MySQL is used. Adapt the code accordingly.


        // STEP 3: Obtain a connection to the JDND-C3 database

        // STEP 4: Use Statement to INSERT 2 records into the member table
        // NOTE: The member table is created using Flyway by placing the migration file in src/main/resources/db/migration


        // STEP 5: Read ALL the rows from the member table and print them here


        // STEP 6: verify that all inserted rows have been printed
